# COVIDSafe-CVE-2020-12856: A bluetooth-related vulnerability in some contact tracing apps

Authors: Jim Mussared (George Robotics), Alwen Tiu (The Australian National University)

A vulnerability has been identified in the implementation of the Android version of Australia's COVIDSafe (v1.9.17 and earlier) contact tracing app that may affect several other contact tracing apps that share a similar architecture, such as Singapore's TraceTogether and Alberta's ABTraceTogether. This issue is being tracked using the CVE ID [CVE-2020-12856](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-12856). 
This vulnerability allows an attacker to bond silently with an Android phone running a vulnerable version of the app. The bonding process involves exchanges of permanent identifiers of the victim phone: the identity address of the bluetooth device in the phone and a cryptographic key called Identity Resolving Key (IRK). Either one of these identifiers can be used for long term tracking of the phone.  

This vulnerability was reported to DTA (who is responsible for the COVIDSafe app) on May 5th, 2020, and it has been fixed in COVIDSafe (Android) v1.0.18.
