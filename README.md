A vulnerability has been identified in the implementation of the Android version of Australia's COVIDSafe contact tracing app that may affect several other contact tracing apps that share a similar architecture, such as Singapore's TraceTogether and Alberta's ABTraceTogether. This issue is being tracked using the CVE ID [CVE-2020-12856](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-12856). The vulnerability allows for long term tracking of users of the affected apps, and possibly enables other bluetooth-based attack vectors.

The details of the issue are still currently under embargo, until the developers of the affected apps have been notified and given a chance to put in place mitigation strategies. After the embargo period ends, more details of the issue will be published here.
